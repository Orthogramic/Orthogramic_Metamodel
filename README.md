# Orthogramic Metamodel

The **Orthogramic Metamodel** is an open-source, schema-first framework for business architecture. It provides a structured and extensible foundation to describe how an organisation operates, delivers value, and responds to change. Designed for clarity, integration, and automation, it supports strategic alignment, governance, and continuous improvement at scale.

## What’s included

The metamodel is composed of structured JSON Schemas for all core business architecture domains:

- **Strategy** – Goals, drivers, and strategic direction  
- **Capabilities** – What the organisation is able to do  
- **Value Streams** – How value is delivered across stages  
- **Organisation** – Units, roles, structure, and ownership  
- **Stakeholders** – People and groups with influence or interest  
- **Information** – Business-critical data and governance  
- **Performance** – Measurable indicators of success (KPIs)  
- **Initiatives** – Projects and programs driving change  
- **Policy** – Rules, compliance, and governance  
- **Products** – Tangible or intangible deliverables  
- **Services** – Activities that create value through interaction  
- **Inter-unit Domain Relationships** – Links between units and domain artefacts  
- **Strategic Response Model (SRM)** – How the organisation responds to triggers and rationales

All domains are defined using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), ensuring they are machine-readable and interoperable across platforms.

## Why Orthogramic?

Orthogramic differs from traditional frameworks like BIZBOK in key ways:

- **Open-source and transparent** – Freely licensed under Creative Commons  
- **Schema-first and digital** – Designed for automation, integration, and validation  
- **Inclusive and scalable** – Usable by strategists, analysts, and business teams, not just architects  
- **Real-time and actionable** – Supports dynamic alignment and structured decision-making  
- **Integrated** – Performance and policy domains are built in, not bolted on
